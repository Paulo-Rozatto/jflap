# JFLAP 7.1 with Maven

There is no support for JFLAP for a while, so I'm updating the project for making it easier compiled with maven.

The JFLAP license requires me to inform how to someone can get in contact with me. Well, you can open issues here or email
me to rozatto.paulo.victor@gmail.com.

## Build
```shell
mvn clean package
```

## Run
```shell
java -jar target/JFlap-7.1-MAVEN-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
